__Which human genes are implicated in tumor development__? 

**geneOncoX** is an R package that address this question through the integration of a number of resources with respect to cancer gene annotations, including, but not limited to:

-   [IntOGen](https://www.intogen.org/download) - compendium of mutational cancer driver genes
-   [Network of Cancer Genes](http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk/) - collection of curated cancer genes
-   [CancerMine](http://bionlp.bcgsc.ca/cancermine/) - text-mined predictions of tumor suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes and cancer drivers
-   [Cancer Gene Census](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census) - manually curated resource on cancer genes (soma and germline)
-   [DNA repair genes](https://www.mdanderson.org/documents/Labs/Wood-Laboratory/human-dna-repair-genes.html) - collection of genes involved in DNA repair
-   [Genomics England PanelApp](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/) - collections of cancer gene panels used in clinical diagnostics
-   [TSO500 targets](https://emea.illumina.com/products/by-brand/trusight-oncology/tso-500-portfolio.html) - cancer genes targeted by Illumina's TSO500 gene panel
-   [F1CDx targets](https://www.foundationmedicine.com/test/foundationone-cdx) - cancer genes targeted by Foundation One's F1CDx gene panel

The package offers a few pre-processed datasets, along with metadata, that the user can retrieve and use for their own projects or set-ups. The package utilizes the [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) R package to download the pre-processed and documented datasets to a local cache directory provided by the user.
